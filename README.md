# toy_transformer_code
Python notebooks to do experiments with toy transformer models

`transformer_tests.py` contains a bunch of custom functions, drawing heavily from Neel Nanda's TransformerLens tutorials and [these](https://arena-ch1-transformers.streamlit.app/) excellent tutorials by Callum McDougall.

The code in `induction_head_recency_bias.ipynb` produces the results discussed in [https://efarrell1.github.io/posts/recency-bias-induction-head/](https://efarrell1.github.io/posts/recency-bias-induction-head/).

The code in `generalised_induction_sequences.ipynb` produces the results discussed in [https://efarrell1.github.io/posts/recency-bias-induction-head/](https://efarrell1.github.io/posts/generalised-induction/).

The code in `previous-token-head.ipynb` approximately reproduces the results discussed in [https://efarrell1.github.io/posts/previous-token-head/](https://efarrell1.github.io/posts/previous-token-head/).

The code in `Positional_Embeddings` approximately reproduces the results in [https://efarrell1.github.io/posts/pos-embeddings-2layer/](https://efarrell1.github.io/posts/pos-embeddings-2layer/)
